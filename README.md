# Treasury Terrene
### A compendium for your Dungeons and Dragons campaign

If you are a fan of pen-and-paper roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, you'd know that you need to have access to a LOT of information and you need it close by. Flipping through a big book of monsters to find out a stat-block can time consuming, especially when so many monsters inside it won't ever show up!

I made this application for everyone to more easily keep track of game details. Everything is indexed into categories and easily accessible within an easy-to-navigate header.

You can add, edit, and delete things in categories such as maps, monsters, NPCs, quests, and special items. Clicking on any of these in the navigation bar will take you to that category's index page.

From there, you can choose one of the names in the list to get more information about it...

...and either edit it, or go back to the category's index page.

If you are routed within a category, you can see on the header the option to either add something new or navigate to the delete list.
